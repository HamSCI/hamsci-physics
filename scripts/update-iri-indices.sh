# Update PHaRLAP / IRI-2020 solar & geomagnetic index files.
#
# IRI-2020 reads two files at runtime to look up F10.7, Ap, IG12, and Rz12
# for the requested date. PHaRLAP ships them as a snapshot, which goes stale
# fast — when the requested date falls past the last entry, IRI prints
#   APF_ONLY: Date is outside range of F10.7D indices file ...
# and silently falls back to climatology, hurting ray-trace accuracy.
#
# Run via systemd timer (hamsci-physics-iri-update.timer), daily. Output goes
# to the systemd journal.
#
# Files refreshed, in EVERY IRI data directory present:
#   apf107.dat   (daily F10.7 + Ap)
#   ig_rz.dat    (monthly IG12 + Rz12)
# in PHaRLAP's /opt/pharlap_4.7.4/dat/iri2020 where PHaRLAP is installed, and
# in each sigmond venv's iri2020 package (site-packages/iri2020/data), which
# is the copy hf-timestd's IRI actually reads on most stations.  Until
# 2026-11-13 only PHaRLAP's copy was refreshed, the timer was never enabled,
# and B4's package copy ended 2023-06-29: IRI ran on climatology fleet-wide.
#
# IRI_DAT_DIRS (space-separated) and IRI_SOURCES override discovery and the
# download sources, for tests.
#
# Sources (in priority order):
#   1. chain-new.chain-project.net (eCHAIM mirror — updated daily)
#   2. irimodel.org (IRI project — slower update cadence)
